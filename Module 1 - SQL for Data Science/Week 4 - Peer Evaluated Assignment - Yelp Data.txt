Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:

--Code
Select *
From table
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000 
iii. Category table =10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000 
v. elite_years table = 10000 
vi. friend table = 10000 
vii. hours table = 10000 
viii. photo table = 10000 
ix. review table = 10000 
x. tip table = 10000 
xi. user table = 10000 
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

--Code
Select Count(DISTINCT(key))
From table

i. Business = 10000 (Primary Key: id)
ii. Hours = 1562 (Foreign Key: business_id)
iii. Category = 2643 (Foreign Key: business_id)
iv. Attribute = 1115 (Foreign Key: business_id)
v. Review = 8090 (Foreign Key: business_id)
vi. Checkin = 493 (Foreign Key: business_id)
vii. Photo = 6493 (Foreign Key: business_id)
viii. Tip = 3979 (Foreign Key: business_id)
ix. User = 10000 (Primary Key: id)
x. Friend = 11 (Foreign Key: user_id)
xi. Elite_years = 2780 (Foreign Key: user_id)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: No

--Code
Select MIN(column)
From table

Select MAX(column)

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	Yes, there seems to be a correlation between number of fans and review count. In general, users with higher review counts have more fans and vice-versa. This correlation is more apparent when the top 20  is compared with the bottom 20 users (by number of fans).

	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: There are more reviews with "love".

+-----------------+				
| ReviewsWithLove |
+-----------------+

+-----------------+

+-----------------+
| ReviewsWithHate |
+-----------------+
|             232 |

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
City: Las Vegas
Category: Restaurants
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

Based on the limited sample, Las Vegas restaurants with 2-3 stars seem to stay open later into the night (12am). Whereas resstaurants with 4-5 stars seem to close slightly earlier. However, it is not valid to ecxtend this generalization to all restaurants in Las Vegas as there was only 1 restaurant in the 2-3 star category, and the rating of 2-3 star restaurant did not differ much to the 4-5 star restaurant; one can argue that 4 stars vs 3 stars is hardly a signifcant difference given the subjectivity of star ratings.    

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

Yes. There seems to be a significant difference in review counts for 2-3 star vs 4-5 star restaurants. However, caution must be applied to generalizations beyond this sample set given the points highlighted in part i.       
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
No. Each restaurant has a different postal code.


SQL code used for analysis:

Select b.name,c.category,b.postal_code, b.stars,h.hours,b.review_count,
CASE
  when h.hours Like '%monday%' Then 1
  when h.hours Like '%tuesday%' Then 2
  when h.hours Like '%wednesday%' Then 3
  when h.hours Like '%thursday%' Then 4
  when h.hours Like '%friday%' Then 5
  when h.hours Like '%saturday%' Then 6
  when h.hours Like '%sunday%' Then 7
END DayOrder,
CASE
  When b.Stars between 2 and 3 Then '2-3 stars'
  When b.Stars between 4 and 5 Then '4-5 stars'
END RatingCategory
From (business b inner join category c on b.id=c.business_id) 
inner join hours h on b.id=h.business_id
Where b.city='Las Vegas' AND c.Category='Restaurants'
Order By RatingCategory,b.id, DayOrder
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
Opened stores have on average higher rating.

+---------------+-------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
| OpeningStatus | Count | AverageRating | MinimumRating | MaximumRating |
+---------------+-------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
| Closed        |   122 | 3.66393442623 |           1.5 |           5.0 |
| Opened        |   574 | 3.89982578397 |           1.0 |           5.0 |
+---------------+-------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
         
ii. Difference 2:
There are more opened than closed stores.

+---------------+-------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
| OpeningStatus | Count | AverageRating | MinimumRating | MaximumRating |
+---------------+-------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
| Closed        |   122 | 3.66393442623 |           1.5 |           5.0 |
| Opened        |   574 | 3.89982578397 |           1.0 |           5.0 |
+---------------+-------+---------------+---------------+---------------+         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

Select
CASE
  When b.is_open=0 Then 'Closed'
  When b.is_open=1 Then 'Opened'
END AS OpeningStatus,
COUNT(Stars) AS Count,
AVG(Stars) AS AverageRating,
MIN(Stars) AS MinimumRating,
MAX(Stars) AS MaximumRating
FROM Business b inner join category c on b.id=c.business_id
Group by b.is_open 
Order By b.is_open

	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

Predicting the star rating of a business based on relevant indicators. 
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

I will need features that I believe are good indicators of a business' star rating. Such features include a business' location, attributes, and categories. I decided to use an inner join so that only business' with all the chosen fields are selected for the analysis. As such, one must be careful of applying any generalizations beyond this dataset. The output of this SQL query can be used as input for a suitable machine learning algorithm that is trained then used to make predictions about a business' star rating. In this partiocular example, Random Forests is a good candidate model given the columns types (lots of categorical features).
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
